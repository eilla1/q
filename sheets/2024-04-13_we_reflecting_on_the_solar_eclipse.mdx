# Reflecting on the Solar Eclipse

### On the experience

I viewed the eclipse from an empty parking lot across the street from the building I live in. Being in a rural area, there were only a few other spectators around, and it was generally quiet. I appreciated the opportunity to enjoy the experience in a quiet setting. However, I also considered how experience would have been different if I were watching from a park in Burlington, surrounded by thousands of other people. Perhaps sharing the experience with others would have made it more meaningful or insightful. Having witnessed many partial solar eclipses, I was unsure what to expect from the total solar eclipse. Seeing the sun get covered by the moon and the sky darken for a few minutes was fascinating. Prior to the eclipse, I listened to podcasts and read articles to familiarize myself with scientific knowledge and societal implications of such an event. One [podcast episode on NYT's _The Daily_ featured Fred Espenak](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/podcasts/the-daily/mr-eclipse.html), a lifelong eclipse chaser, who mentioned he could identify photographs of various eclipses he has because the shape of the corona is unique in each one. I was intrigued by this statement and observed the corona closely as I watched the moon cover the sun for a few short minutes.

### On the event

I attended a talk called ["Socio-Cultural Dimensions of Eclipses,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCncXrmes0o) where UVM anthropology professor Luis Vivanco lectured on the cultural meanings and social contexts surrounding eclipses. It was fascinating to learn about how ancient civilizations responded to eclipses. For instance, in ancient Indian civilization, celestial, solar, and lunar events played significant roles in religious lore and traditions. During an eclipse, people refrained from eating, drinking, any form of swallowing, or sleeping, and afterward, they cleaned themselves by bathing and changing clothes. Dr. Vivanco also discussed cultural and social practices around solar eclipses in modern society. It was particularly interesting to explore various perspectives. In science and education, astronomers and scholars compete and collaborate to document eclipses and develop technologies to capture them more effectively. Everyday citizens prepare for the event by taking practical measures such as stocking up on gasoline or food. Governing officials plan for logistical and infrastructural challenges for an unusually large movement of people. Business owners anticipate the economic impacts of increased visitation to the area. On the day of the total eclipse, many workplaces and schools closed, and people traveled to witness the celestial phenomenon. While specific practices and traditions differ, modern and ancient civilizations share the experience of life pausing during an eclipse.
