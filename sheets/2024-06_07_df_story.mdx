# Scene Exercise 1: Story

The exercise is to make a film that visually tells the story of a quote from a book/movie/etc. The quote I chose is from Jon Krakauer's _Into the Wild_.

> "Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality, nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun" (Krakauer 56).

## Treatment

**Working Title:** "Adventure"

**Logline:** Feeling trapped in a monotonous life, a person goes to seek adventure in the everyday, discovering that ordinary activities can lead to extraordinary experiences.

**Introduction:** The main character is a young person living in a small apartment in a rural town. The person spends the majority of their time between school and work. They feels a growing sense of weariness and monotony in their life.

### Act 1

> The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun."

The film opens with a person living in a small apartment in a rural town. The walls of the apartment are decorated with maps and posters of far-away mountains, lakes, and deserts, reflecting a desire for adventure. Their daily routine is shown in a series of short repetitive shotsâ€”waking up to the alarm, rushing to the bus stop, doing homework, and going to bed. The monotony of their life is emphasized by gray/dull tones.

### Act 2

> So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind.

The person decides to challenge themselves to find adventure in their surroundings and ways to incorporate it into their everyday routine. They decide to ride their bike to work/school instead of commuting by motorized transit. The journey is depicted as both fun and physically challenging. They encounter steep hills, busy roads, and find beauty in the roadside vegetation and landscape.

In another adventure, the person goes on a short midweek bike camping trip where they sleep at the top of a hill (watertower) and watch the sun set and rise.

### Act 3

> Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt.

The person's adventures continue. They go about their life limiting the use of any kind of motorized transport, often having to walk in the shoulder of a highway. They decide to hike up a trail-less mountain using a map and compass. They forage food from grocery store dumpsters.

As the film progresses, the color gradually shifts from monotonous to vibrant, reflecting their internal transformation. Their previous melancholy demeanor shifts to one of newfound joy.
