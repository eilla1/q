# Week 1

Water pours from the sky, down the trail like a waterfall, sweeping sediment along and leaving a deep gulley in its wake. An earthy scent lingers in the humid air among a forest of evergreen trees. On the summit, harsh winds batter the fragile alpine vegetation and threatening clouds are seen looming in the distance. Just below, a group of hikers scramble up a steep slab, boots squeaking as they carefully slide along the slick rock. Above the pitch, a trail crew, steel tools in hand, stand around a boulder strategically planning its position as a stair step in the trail.
