# Toy Electric Motor

The lab for this week was building an electricmagnetic motor.

We created a simple electromagnet by wrapping insulated wire around a magnet (two armature halves) attached to an axle (motor shaft). The axle suspended the magnet in the middle of a horseshoe magnet (field pole). We then hooked up the two ends of the wires from the field pole to a battery. The battery flips the polarity of the electromagnet so it continously turns.
