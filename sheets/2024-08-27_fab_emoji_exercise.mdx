# Emoji

The purpose of this assignment was to gain familiarity with Adobe Illustrator by drawing up an (existing) emoji and preparing files for the laser and digital embroidery machines respectively.

### Laser file:

The left side of the nose is a cut line because I thought the burn marks would add a nice shadow. The mustache is hatched instead of solid for variety in texture.
