# Jet Vehicle Design

## Objectives

{/* Problem Definition – Clearly describe the problem(s) & objectives */}

- payload
  - the vehicle needs to travel across a wooden board and land in a target range of 152-172" while carrying as much weight in marbles as possible
- speed
  - fastest time to traverse 75” speed zone, with a 20"-40" acceleration zone

## Jet Exhaust and Thrust

{/* Clearly describe your method to estimate the exit velocity of jet exhaust and thrust produced. Be sure to use data from manometer lab. Provide sample calculations. */}

## Brainstorming & Evaluation of Ideas

{/* Brainstorming – Generate possible solutions & strategies, Evaluation – Clearly show the metrics you have used to evaluate potential solutions */}

### Design considerations

- wheels or ski runners?

  Ski runners on a lighter body may save weight and have the potenial to go further, but it's also more prone to go out of straightness.

  If the 4-wheeled vehicle and the vehicle on ski runners used the same body, I think the wheeled vehicle would go further because the rotational motion would allow the vehicle to keep moving a bit even after the balloon deflates.

  Perhaps we may not want the vehicle to go further after the baloon deflates because the goal is to land in a very specific range (orbital), and it would just be more predictable to not have the vehicle keep traveling after the baloon deflates/ jet exhaust is depleted.

  One concern with the wheels might be energy lost from wobbling/friction. To remedy that, 3D printed bushings would do the job.

- constraints

  The vehicle is not to exceed 15” in any of the 3 dimensions. The only stored energy / power permitted is jet propulsion from the pressure vessel and nozzle. Nozzle to be fabricated with the rapid prototype machines. Vehicle cannot be modified during the competition. Off-the-shelf parts are not allowed.

### Body

- aerodynamic body geometry to reduce air resistance
- must accomodate propulsion system (balloon), wheels, and some way to carry cargo
  - is there a certain balloon size that would create more thrust velocity? I would imagine a larger balloon would not necessarily equal more power because acceleration etc.
- idea: rectangular prism with tapered ends to reduce drag

### Materials

- 1/8" acrylic is generally more dense than the most dry 1/8" baltic birch plywood
- thin PLA shell vs 1/8" baltic birch plywood is unknown
  - consider durability of PLA - how thin can we go while ensuring the vehicle's structural integrity?
  - this should be tested.

#### BoM

- balloon
