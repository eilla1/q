# Shooting for match cuts

## Treatment

**Working title:** Bikes

**Logline:** Bicycles bring us places and teach us things along the way.

**Key Characters:** A Person (protagonist), some other background persons (for the group ride)

### Act 1: Routine to adventure

A person, the protagonist, starts their day. The alarm rings, and it’s quickly followed by frantically preparing for the daily commute. This is shown with quick cuts of packing a bag, making a quick breakfast, and heading out the door. The commute begins on busy roads, shown through shots of traffic, then transitions to quieter dirt roads. The person arrives a building, locks the bike, and heads inside. (scene 1)

As the day ends, the person heads back to the bike and rides home. The bike is quickly packed with gear for an overnight trip. Quick cuts show securing various bags to the bike. The scenery changes from suburban to rural and remote. As the sun sets, the person sets up camp. (scene 2)

### Act 2: Solitude to community

In the morning, the protagonist packs up camp and rides home. The ride is shown through shots of navigating various terrain including single track, hills, and endless dirt roads. (scene 1)

The protagonist rides into town where a group of cyclists is gathering. The group sets off, riding through town and onto backroads. They stop at a viewpoint, share moments of camaraderie, and transformation is shown through the shift from solitary activity to a communal experience. The group rides back into town. (scene 2)

### Act 3: Learning and overcoming challenges

The protagonist faces a flat tire during a ride. Shots of the repair process are shown—removing the wheel, patching the tube, and putting it back on. Some time passes. The protagonist sets up their bike on a repair stand and performs maintenance such as lubricating the chain and truing the wheel, consulting a manual for guidance. (scene 1)

The newly repaired bike is taken outside for a ride. Shots of the bike being ridden on variable terrain in variable weather conditions symbolizes growth and resilience. The scene ends on a happy note, showing the satisfaction of overcoming challenges. (scene 2)
