# Apollo Case Study Research Notes

### Engineering problem statement

- to land American astronauts on the moon and return them safely to Earth

### Quick Background

- first crewed mission of the Apollo program, which aimed to land astronauts on the Moon and return them safely to Earth
- scheduled to launch on February 21, 1967
- crew consisted of three experienced astronauts: Virgil "Gus" Grissom, Edward H. White II, and Roger B. Chaffee

### Detailed technical description of design solution

Single (oxygen) vs two gas (oxygen and nitrogen) design

- Decided to go with 100% oxygen atmosphere
- Two gas design with tanks and all would add 500 lbs of extra weight
- Con: Physiological issues associated with pure oxy environment - eye irritation, hearing effects, clogged chest
- increased fire hazard with pure oxygen environment
- one gas design successfully used on Mercury and Gemini missions with no fire incident

Hatch design

- Prev hatch design used explosive bolts. This one had \_\_ bolts and opened inwards. Pressure buildup inside the cabin create massive forces against openeing the door
  - Difficult to egress

Flammable materials

- Velcro
- Horizontal flame test
- 100% oxygen

### The primary cause, or sequence of events, leading to failure

- Budget and schedule pressures
  - President Kennedy’s challenge of landing a person on the moon before 1970 fostered an environment where people push themselves with high stakes and high risk to meet a set goal
  - National pressure from post Cold War
  - NAA under scrutiny and criticism from NASA due to cost overruns and schedule delays in years leading up to Apollo 1
- Emergency preparedness
  - Inadequate provisions onsite for emergency response / medical rescue in event of emergency

#### Recount of events

- On Jan 27, 1967, the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34A was the site for the "plugs out" test. This was a test of the vehicle to see how it performs under internal power, without conecting the ship to off-board power. This was considered safe because pryotechnic systems were not armed, and the rocket was not fueled.
- 1pm: Crew climbs into capsule and strapped into their seats
- shortly after - foul odor from Grissom's suit. Engineers could not identify a cause for the odor but proceeded with operation, closing the complicated 3 layer hatch
- The air in the cockpit was replaced by pure oxygen pressurized to 16.7 psi, to drive out atmospheric air and to seal the plug door.

  - How the door works: it seals itself by taking advantage of a pressure difference established across its two sides. The wedge shaped door forced into socket and forms seal that prevents it from being opened until cabin pressure is released

- communication problems all afternoon, and at 6:30pm the countdown remained on hold

  - “How are we going to get to the moon if we can’t talk between 3 buildings” - Grissom

- At 6:30pm, engineers detected a power surge that caused a short circuit, very likely sparked by a chafed wire below Grissom's seat. Possible malfunction in wire insulation. The initial source of fuel was likely the polyetheylyen tubing covering the wires, and then spread to the leg rests, seats, and velcro hooks. There were a lot of flammable materials in the cabin.
- Hatch design too complicated to egress the crew quickly in emergencies. The astronauts struggled to open to main hatch.
  - In the Mercury spacecraft which preceded the Apollo program, the hatch used explosive bolts so they could be easily opened in an emergency. For the Apollo spacecraft, engineers decided to omit the explosive hatch because during a previous Mercury mission, the hatch blew unexpectedly after a splashdown landing[^1]
- At 6:31pm, the pressure inside reached 29 psi and burst the inner wall of the CM, allowing ambient air tinto the cabin.

- Ground controllers were able to open the hatch by 6:36pm, and it took 7 and a half hours after the fire to remove the astronauts' bodies. The nylon space suits and life support hoses were melted and the bodies were fused to the interior of the cockpit.

### Consequences, in terms of engineers, society, business, and the environment

Engineering:

- safety: underscored need for stringent safety protocols in design and testing
- safety: prompted NASA to reassess engineering practices, revise spacecraft designs, testing procedures, and safety measures
- design improvements: scrutinized Apollo 1 spacecraft design to identify hazards and improve safety features to improve crew safety and reliability
- eng culture: brought a culture of safety in engineering, emphasizing need for through testing, risk assessment and safety standards in aerospace engineering

Society:

- public awareness: raise awareness about dangers and risks, challenges, sacrifies associated with manned space missions
- government oversight: prompted increased government oversight and regulation of space exploration programs to ensure safety of astronauts and the public while working towards space exploration goals

Business:

- finanical imlplicatons: siginificant financial losses for NASA - investigation/redesign/delays in Apollo program schedule
- industry standards: prompted stricter industry safety/testing/design standards for the field in general

### Corrective actions in order to prevent similar disasters in the future.

- cultural shift towards safety
  - establishment of independent review boards and oversight committees to evaluate spacecraft design, testing procedures, and safety measures
- redesign
  - CM: replacing flammable materials with more fire-resistant alternatives, improving electrical wiring and insulation, making structural modifications to improve crew safety
  - cabin atmosphere: adoption of non-flammable atmospheres in spacecraft during ground tests and missions
  - hatch: redesigning the hatch to open outward instead of inward, simplifying the latch mechanism, and incorporating a quick-release mechanism for emergency egress
