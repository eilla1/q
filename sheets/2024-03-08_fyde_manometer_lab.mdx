Uncertainty Quantification & Error Analysis
Engineers and scientists performing experiments ‐ whether those experiments are fundamental in nature or applied in the design process ‐ must have a firm understanding of, and be able to, quantify error and uncertainty. This is a key factor in the design, analysis, and decision making process. As such, be sure to address the following in your write‐up and analysis:
 Estimate and discuss the accuracy of the results when using the assumption that the air in the bladder is in thermal equilibrium with the room temperature.
 When reading the manometer, what is the error associated with this measurement? How will this error propagate in the calculations? What is the “order of the error,” i.e., to the nearest inch, nearest 1/2 inch, nearest 1/10 of an inch, nearest 1/100 of an inch? Justify your response.
 What are the main sources of error in the calculation of the balloon volume? What do you think the % error is associated with this calculation? Support your value with a logical argument.
 Are there other sources of error in this experiment? Please explain a few of them.
 Suggest some alternative methods to reduce error and thus improve the accuracy of the results.
Note: The experimental data acquired during this lab will be used as the propellant ‘stagnation chamber’ conditions for the jet vehicle competition. The pressure, volume, and mass of air in the bladder will be employed to ‘launch’ a payload into ‘orbit’ and calculations of Force, Work, Power, and Efficiency will be performed.
