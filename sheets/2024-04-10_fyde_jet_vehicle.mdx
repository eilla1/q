# Jet Vehicle

## v0

The vehicle body uses a basic rectangular geometry with tabs on the bottom for axles and finger joints for assembly. The vehicle was designed in OnShape, then exported DXFs of the various faces to edit in AutoCAD. I used AutoCAD to add the finger joints and prepare the file for laser cutting.

Vehicle assembly in 3D.

This is the laser cut file for the body.

## v1 changelog

I used the variable studio feature in OnShape to generate varying sizes of nozzles for testing. We tested using the v0 design and just switched the nozzle.

| Nozzle exit diameter | distance | speed over ?? in |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 15mm                 |          |                  |
| 12mm                 |          |                  |
| 10mm                 |          |                  |
| 5mm                  |          |                  |

For the body, there is now a hole for the nozzle so it sits more securely on the vehicle. The bottom of the vehicle is perforated to reduce weight.

The wheels now use a spoked design instead of solid to save weight. The wheels also have spacers, so there is less friction when the axles move left and right.
