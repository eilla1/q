# Cause and Effect

**Topic:** sustainability in the context of outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism

### Cause: visitation exceeding capacity of infrastructure

The popularity of idyllic backcountry locations is on the rise, driven by the widespread use of social technologies. One such example is geotagging. This practice involves social media users posting geographic coordinate information attached to images, videos, and other media, enticing others to visit. This is a problem for remote, lesser-known destinations that are now receiving record visitation. This is less of an issue for famous landmarks and national parks because the infrastructure there exists to accommodate large numbers of tourists.

Robust infrastructure is essential for ensuring a sustainable cycle for recreation and tourism. Proper signage, facilities, and regulations all play an important role in minimizing negative impacts and creating a good experience for visitors. Educational signage can inform visitors about the history and significance of the natural environment and wildlife around them. With this knowledge, visitors are more likely to respect and understand the ecosystem they are exploring. Trail markers or signs help visitors stay on the designated path and prevent wandering off trail, disturbing the surrounding habitat and vegetation. In addition to signage, facilities such as visitor centers can provide a space for visitor education and programs. Facilities may also include outhouses and other waste management infrastructure to minimize pollution in natural areas.

The implementation of regulations may vary from region to region depending on climate, activities, and local wildlife. One example of a regulation is the use of permit systems. Requiring a permit for certain activities such as camping, hiking, or fishing can help regulate visitor numbers and distribute use evenly throughout the season. Moreover, wildlife protection regulations can help ensure that recreational activities do not disturb the local wildlife. Establishing seasonal closures or restricted access zones in sensitive areas can help safeguard wildlife populations and their habitats.

### Cause: unusual climate and weather patterns

In July of last year, Vermont experienced catastrophic flooding as a result of unprecedented rainfall. This extreme weather event had significant repercussions on outdoor recreational areas, causing extensive damage to trails and park infrastructure. Despite this, there are instances where certain locations fared better. For example, the Burrows trail on Camelâ€™s Hump withstood the storm relatively well, largely due to recent maintenance efforts. Features like rock structures, including water bars, staircases, and check steps, have been instrumental in fortifying trails against erosion. Water bars, strategically positioned above staircases, redirect water flow away from trails, preventing erosion. Staircases create durable tread in places that are very steep, slabby, and prone to erosion. Check steps serve a similar purpose to staircases; the only difference is that steps in a series of check steps do not touch.

In addition to the summer floods, the region has also witnessed irregular weather patterns, such as unseasonal warm spells during winter months. These episodes accelerate snowmelt, exposing underlying trails and saturating them with water. Every year from late March to May, trails become extremely muddy, and hikers are encouraged to seek alternatives if the trails are muddy, to prevent damage and erosion. Additionally, muddy trails prompt hikers to walk off designated paths, causing damage to surrounding vegetation and widening the trail. Over time, these cumulative effects exacerbate the degradation of outdoor recreational areas.

### Cause: management and stakeholder involvement

There are many groups that come together to discuss and decide on issues around the management of recreational areas and activities. In the climbing community, CRAG-VT is a Vermont-based nonprofit focused on the conservation and advocacy of sustainable rock climbing. The organization promotes stewardship by organizing trail work days where the climbing community comes together to work on general maintenance and clean up around climbing areas. The organization is governed by a board that meets monthly to discuss issues and concerns. Similarly, many towns have committees that meet regularly to discuss things pertaining to recreation.

### Cause: lack of education and awareness around ethics

### Effect: Negative ecological impacts

The construction of mountain roads, such as the Toll Road on Mt. Mansfield in VT and Mt. Washington in NH, has made these popular destinations more accessible, but it comes with ecological consequences. Firstly, the presence of vehicles traveling at high speeds poses a hazard to wildlife in these areas. Additionally, on fragile ecosystems like the alpine vegetation along the Mt. Mansfield ridgeline, it's crucial for visitors to refrain from walking on these delicate plants, which are already rare and endangered. Instead, utilizing durable surfaces such as rock and puncheon helps mitigate ecological damage. Irresponsible and uninformed outdoor recreation practices can exacerbate these impacts. For instance, certain cliff areas are closed seasonally during falcon nesting season. It's imperative for climbers and hikers to respect these closures to avoid disturbing endangered species and their habitats.

### Effect: social and cultural effects

Unsustainable outdoor recreation practices also give rise to adverse social consequences. As destinations become increasingly overcrowded and the natural environment deteriorates, visitors are often disappointed when they discover that the experience doesn't align with their expectations. This dissatisfaction can lead to frustration and conflict among visitors and local communities. Furthermore, in economic terms, while increased visitation may create more job opportunities for individuals working in those areas initially, the long-term viability of these jobs may be compromised if the natural resources and landscapes that attract visitors are degraded beyond repair. Thus, there is a delicate balance between promoting tourism for economic growth and preserving the natural environment and quality of the visitor experience.

### Effect: economic effects

An increase in outdoor recreation, whether it brings positive or negative impacts, typically correlates with more job opportunities. Conservation organizations such as the Green Mountain Club and the VYCC recruit seasonal employees to manage backcountry locations. These roles often involve tasks such as educating visitors at popular destinations like summits and ponds. Caretakers are stationed at all 4,000-foot summits where fragile alpine vegetation exists, ensuring hikers remain on durable surfaces. Caretakers also answer questions and inform visitors about the area they are in. Additionally, volunteers and caretakers play a vital role in maintaining backcountry shelters and privies (outhouses). These facilities are constructed in order to concentrate human impact in a dedicated area. This protects the surrounding vegetation from being disturbed by activities such as camping and human waste. Many older privies are equipped with bins underneath the toilet where waste is collected, which is then mixed with bark mulch and other sources of carbon for decomposition. Regular aeration of the waste pile facilitates decomposition, contributing to the sustainability of these facilities. In addition to using the facilities along the trail, long distance hikers also pass through many quaint mountain towns, stopping for sustenance, overnight accommodation, among other amenities. During the summer months, these towns heavily depend on hikers, while in winter, they thrive on skiers and snowboarders. Something something job opportunities.

### Effect: displacement of local communities

The influx of outdoor recreation, particularly in areas with popular ski resorts, has
led to displacement and fragmentation of local communities. Short-term rentals are prevalent in these towns, where individuals purchase properties for seasonal use or rent them out to tourists. In Stratton and Killington, two towns in Vermont with well-known ski areas, the impact of this is evident. According to data from the Vermont Center for Geographic Information, 87% and 75% of land ownership in Stratton and Killington respectively is held by out-of-state individuals. This ownership dynamic can create detachment between property owners and the local community, as seasonal residents may not have the same interest in the long-term well-being of the area. Furthermore, the rise of short-term rentals exacerbates this issue by fragmenting neighborhoods and diminishing the sense of community cohesion. Homes that were once inhabited year-round by locals are now frequently occupied by visitors seeking temporary accommodation.

The impact on housing affordability is also a concern. As more people seek to buy single-family homes near ski resorts, the demand for housing in these areas skyrockets, driving up prices and making it increasingly difficult for local residents to afford homes. This can force long-standing community members to relocate to more affordable areas, disrupting established social networks and traditions. In response to these challenges, local municipalities are exploring regulatory measures to mitigate the negative effects of short-term rentals. This may include implementing zoning ordinances to restrict short-term rentals, imposing occupancy limits, or introducing affordable housing initiatives to ensure that residents have access to housing options that meet their needs.
