# Cause and Effect

**Topic:** sustainability in the context of outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism

### **Cause 1:** visitation exceeding capacity of infrastructure

The popularity of idyllic backcountry locations is on the rise, driven by the widespread use of social technology like geotagging. This practice involves influential social media users highlighting specific locations, enticing others to visit. Moreover, rare astronomical events such as solar eclipses further draw people to particular areas. For example, Vermont anticipates a surge in visitors in April 2024. Consequently, facilities providing overnight accommodations are reaching maximum capacity, and local businesses are preparing for the influx of crowds.

### **Cause 2:** unusual weather patterns and climate

In July of last year, Vermont experienced catastrophic flooding as a result of unprecedented rainfall. This extreme weather event had significant repercussions on outdoor recreational areas, causing extensive damage to trails and park infrastructure. Despite this, there are instances where certain locations fared better. For example, the Burrows trail on Camelâ€™s Hump withstood the storm relatively well, largely due to recent maintenance efforts. Features like rock structures, including water bars, staircases, and check steps, have been instrumental in fortifying trails against erosion. Water bars, strategically positioned above staircases, redirect water flow away from trails, preventing erosion. However, the region has also witnessed irregular weather patterns, such as unseasonal warm spells during winter months. These episodes accelerate snowmelt, exposing underlying trails and saturating them with water. Consequently, trails become muddy, prompting hikers to walk off designated paths, causing damage to surrounding vegetation and widening the trail. Over time, these cumulative effects exacerbate the degradation of outdoor recreational areas.

### **Cause 3:** TBD

### **Effect 1:** ecological and environmental impacts

The construction of mountain roads, such as the Toll Road on Mt. Mansfield in VT and Mt. Washington in NH, has made these popular destinations more accessible, but it comes with ecological consequences. Firstly, the presence of vehicles traveling at high speeds poses a hazard to wildlife in these areas. Additionally, on fragile ecosystems like the alpine vegetation along the Mt. Mansfield ridgeline, it's crucial for visitors to refrain from walking on these delicate plants, which are already rare and endangered. Instead, utilizing durable surfaces such as rock and puncheon helps mitigate ecological damage. Irresponsible and uninformed outdoor recreation practices can exacerbate these impacts. For instance, the Marshfield ledge cliff in southern Vermont is annually closed during falcon nesting season. It's imperative for climbers and hikers to respect these closures to avoid disturbing endangered species and their habitats.

### **Effect 2:** social and cultural impacts

Unsustainable outdoor recreation practices also give rise to adverse social consequences. As destinations become increasingly overcrowded and the natural environment deteriorates, visitors are often disappointed when they discover that the experience doesn't align with their expectations. This dissatisfaction can lead to frustration and conflict among recreationalists and local communities. Furthermore, in economic terms, while increased visitation may create more job opportunities for individuals working in those areas initially, the long-term viability of these jobs may be compromised if the natural resources and landscapes that attract visitors are degraded beyond repair. Thus, there is a delicate balance between promoting tourism for economic growth and preserving the natural environment and quality of the visitor experience.

### **Effect 3:** economic impacts (job opportunities)

An increase in outdoor recreation, whether it brings positive or negative impacts, typically correlates with more job opportunities. Conservation organizations such as the Green Mountain Club and the VYCC recruit seasonal employees to oversee backcountry locations. These roles often involve tasks such as educating visitors at popular destinations like summits and ponds. Caretakers are stationed at all 4,000-foot summits where fragile alpine vegetation exists, ensuring hikers remain on durable surfaces and answering questions from visitors. Additionally, volunteers and caretakers play a vital role in maintaining backcountry shelters and privies (outhouses). Many older privies are equipped with bins underneath the toilet where waste is collected, which is then mixed with bark mulch and other sources of carbon for decomposition. Regular aeration of the waste pile facilitates decomposition, contributing to the sustainability of these facilities.
